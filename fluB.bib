	Abstract = {A new method called the neighbor-joining method is proposed for reconstructing phylogenetic trees from evolutionary distance data. The principle of this method is to find pairs of operational taxonomic units ({OTUs} [= neighbors]) that minimize the total branch length at each stage of clustering of {OTUs} starting with a starlike tree. The branch lengths as well as the topology of a parsimonious tree can quickly be obtained by using this method. Using computer simulation, we studied the efficiency of this method in obtaining the correct unrooted tree in comparison with that of five other tree-making methods: the unweighted pair group method of analysis, Farris's method, Sattath and Tversky's method, Li's method, and Tateno et al.'s modified Farris method. The new, neighbor-joining method and Sattath and Tversky's method are shown to be generally better than the other methods.},

@article{smith2009,
	Abstract = {In March and early April 2009, a new swine-origin influenza A ({H1N1)} virus (S-{OIV)} emerged in Mexico and the United States. During the first few weeks of surveillance, the virus spread worldwide to 30 countries (as of May 11) by human-to-human transmission, causing the World Health Organization to raise its pandemic alert to level 5 of 6. This virus has the potential to develop into the first influenza pandemic of the twenty-first century. Here we use evolutionary analysis to estimate the timescale of the origins and the early development of the S-{OIV} epidemic. We show that it was derived from several viruses circulating in swine, and that the initial transmission to humans occurred several months before recognition of the outbreak. A phylogenetic estimate of the gaps in genetic surveillance indicates a long period of unsampled ancestry before the S-{OIV} outbreak, suggesting that the reassortment of swine lineages may have occurred years before emergence in humans, and that the multiple genetic ancestry of S-{OIV} is not indicative of an artificial origin. Furthermore, the unsampled history of the epidemic means that the nature and location of the genetically closest swine viruses reveal little about the immediate origin of the epidemic, despite the fact that we included a panel of closely related and previously unpublished swine influenza isolates. Our results highlight the need for systematic surveillance of influenza in swine, and provide evidence that the mixing of new genetic elements in swine can result in the emergence of viruses with pandemic potential in humans.},

@article{guilligay2008,
	Abstract = {Influenza virus {mRNAs} are synthesized by the trimeric viral polymerase using short capped primers obtained by a 'cap-snatching' mechanism. The polymerase {PB2} subunit binds the 5' cap of host pre-{mRNAs}, which are cleaved after 10--13 nucleotides by the {PB1} subunit. Using a library-screening method, we identified an independently folded domain of {PB2} that has specific cap binding activity. The X-ray structure of the domain with bound cap analog {m7GTP} at 2.3-{\AA} resolution reveals a previously unknown fold and a mode of ligand binding that is similar to, but distinct from, other cap binding proteins. Binding and functional studies with point mutants confirm that the identified site is essential for cap binding in vitro and cap-dependent transcription in vivo by the trimeric polymerase complex. These findings clarify the nature of the cap binding site in {PB2} and will allow efficient structure-based design of new anti-influenza compounds inhibiting viral transcription.},

	Abstract = {The {RNA} genome of influenza virus is transcribed and replicated by the viral {RNA} polymerase complex in the cell nucleus. We have generated green fluorescent protein ({GFP)-tagged} polymerase subunits to study the assembly of the polymerase complex. Our results show that individually expressed polymerase basic protein 1 ({PB1)} and polymerase acidic protein ({PA)} subunits were distributed in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, while the polymerase basic protein 2 ({PB2)} subunit accumulated in the nucleus. Although it has been reported that {PB1} alone accumulates in the nucleus, we demonstrate that {PB1} requires the coexpression of {PA} for efficient nuclear accumulation. Our results support a model which proposes that {PB1} and {PA} are transported into the nucleus as a complex.},

@article{sugiyama2009,
	Abstract = {Influenza virus {RNA-dependent} {RNA} polymerase is a multi-functional heterotrimer, which uses a `cap-snatching' mechanism to produce viral {mRNA.} Host cell {mRNA} is cleaved to yield a cap-bearing oligonucleotide, which can be extended using viral genomic {RNA} as a template. The cap-binding and endonuclease activities are only activated once viral genomic {RNA} is bound. This requires signalling from the {RNA-binding} {PB1} subunit to the cap-binding {PB2} subunit, and the interface between these two subunits is essential for the polymerase activity. We have defined this interaction surface by protein crystallography and tested the effects of mutating contact residues on the function of the holo-enzyme. This novel interface is surprisingly small, yet, it has a crucial function in regulating the 250 {kDa} polymerase complex and is completely conserved among avian and human influenza viruses.},

	Abstract = {We improve on earlier {FPT} algorithms for computing a rooted maximum agreement forest ({MAF)} or a maximum acyclic agreement forest ({MAAF)} of a pair of phylogenetic trees. Their sizes give the subtree-prune-and-regraft ({SPR)} distance and the hybridization number of the trees, respectively. We introduce new branching rules that reduce the running time of the algorithms from O(3 k n) and O(3 k n logn) to O(2.42 k n) and O(2.42 k n logn), respectively. In practice, the speed up may be much more than predicted by the worst-case analysis. We confirm this intuition experimentally by computing {MAFs} for simulated trees and trees inferred from protein sequence data. We show that our algorithm is orders of magnitude faster and can handle much larger trees and {SPR} distances than the best previous methods, {treeSAT} and sprdist.},

	Abstract = {Background
Influenza A virus vaccines undergo yearly reformulations due to the antigenic variability of the virus caused by antigenic drift and shift. It is critical to the vaccine manufacturing process to obtain influenza A seed virus that is antigenically identical to circulating wild type (wt) virus and grows to high titers in embryonated chicken eggs. Inactivated influenza A seasonal vaccines are generated by classical reassortment. The classical method takes advantage of the ability of the influenza virus to reassort based on the segmented nature of its genome. In ovo co-inoculation of a high growth or yield (hy) donor virus and a low yield wt virus with antibody selection against the donor surface antigens results in progeny viruses that grow to high titers in ovo with wt origin hemagglutinin ({HA)} and neuraminidase ({NA)} glycoproteins. In this report we determined the parental origin of the remaining six genes encoding the internal proteins that contribute to the hy phenotype in ovo.


Methodology
The genetic analysis was conducted using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ({RT-PCR)} and restriction fragment length polymorphism ({RFLP).} The characterization was conducted to determine the parental origin of the gene segments (hy donor virus or wt virus), gene segment ratios and constellations. Fold increase in growth of reassortant viruses compared to respective parent wt viruses was determined by hemagglutination assay titers.


Significance
In this study fifty-seven influenza A vaccine candidate reassortants were analyzed for the presence or absence of correlations between specific gene segment ratios, gene constellations and hy reassortant phenotype. We found two gene ratios, 6∶2 and 5∶3, to be the most prevalent among the hy reassortants analyzed, although other gene ratios also conferred hy in certain reassortants.},

	Abstract = {Influenza B virus causes a significant amount of morbidity and mortality, yet the systems to produce high yield inactivated vaccines for these viruses have lagged behind the development of those for influenza A virus. We have established a plasmid-only reverse genetics system for the generation of recombinant influenza B virus that facilitates the generation of vaccine viruses without the need for time consuming coinfection and selection procedures currently required to produce reassortants. We cloned the eight viral {cDNAs} of influenza {B/Yamanashi/166/98}, which yields relatively high titers in embryonated chicken eggs, between {RNA} polymerase I and {RNA} polymerase {II} transcription units. Virus was detected as early as 3 days after transfection of cocultured {COS7} and {Madin--Darby} canine kidney cells and achieved levels of 106-107 plaque-forming units per ml of cell supernatant 6 days after transfection. The full-length sequence of the recombinant virus after passage into embryonated chicken eggs was identical to that of the input plasmids. To improve the utility of the eight-plasmid system for generating 6 + 2 reassortants from recently circulating influenza B strains, we optimized the reverse {transcriptase--PCR} for cloning of the hemagglutinin ({HA)} and neuraminidase ({NA)} segments. The six internal genes of {B/Yamanashi/166/98} were used as the backbone to generate 6 + 2 reassortants including the {HA} and {NA} gene segments from {B/Victoria/504/2000}, {B/Hong} Kong/330/2001, and {B/Hawaii/10/2001.} Our results demonstrate that the eight-plasmid system can be used for the generation of high yields of influenza B virus vaccines expressing current {HA} and {NA} glycoproteins from either of the two lineages of influenza B virus.},

	Abstract = {Summary
Hybrids between species are usually unviable or sterile. One possible mechanism causing reproductive isolation is incompatibility between genes from different species. These ``speciation'' genes are interacting components that cannot function properly when mixed with alleles from other species. To test whether such genes exist in two closely related yeast species, we constructed hybrid lines in which one or two chromosomes were derived from Saccharomyces bayanus, and the rest were from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that the hybrid line with Chromosome 13 substitution was completely sterile and identified Aep2, a mitochondrial protein encoded on Chromosome 13, to cause the sporulation defect as S. bayanus {AEP2} is incompatible with S. cerevisiae mitochondria. This is caused by the inability of S. bayanus Aep2 protein to regulate the translation of the S. cerevisiae {OLI1} {mRNA.} We speculate that {AEP2} and {OLI1} have evolved during the adaptation of S. bayanus to nonfermentable carbon sources, thereby driving speciation.},

	Abstract = {Influenza A viruses from wild aquatic birds, their natural reservoir species, are thought to have reached a form of stasis, characterized by low rates of evolutionary change. We tested this hypothesis by estimating rates of nucleotide substitution in a diverse array of avian influenza viruses ({AIV)} and allowing for rate variation among lineages. The rates observed were extremely high, at {\textgreater}10−3 substitutions per site, per year, with little difference among wild and domestic host species or viral subtypes and were similar to those seen in mammalian influenza A viruses. Influenza A virus therefore exhibits rapid evolutionary dynamics across its host range, consistent with a high background mutation rate and rapid replication. Using the same approach, we also estimated that the common ancestors of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase sequences of {AIV} arose within the last 3,000 years, with most intrasubtype diversity emerging within the last 100 years and suggestive of a continual selective turnover.},

	Abstract = {Researchers routinely estimate distances between molecular sequences using continuous-time Markov chain models. We present a new method, robust counting, that protects against the possibly severe bias arising from model misspecification. We achieve this robustness by generalizing the conventional distance estimation to incorporate the empirical distribution of site patterns found in the observed pairwise sequence alignment. Our flexible framework allows for computing distances based only on a subset of possible substitutions. From this, we show how to estimate labeled codon distances, such as expected numbers of synonymous or nonsynonymous substitutions. We present two simulation studies. The first compares the relative bias and variance of conventional and robust labeled nucleotide estimators. In the second simulation, we demonstrate that robust counting furnishes accurate synonymous and nonsynonymous distance estimates based only on easy-to-fit models of nucleotide substitution, bypassing the need for computationally expensive codon models. We conclude with three empirical examples. In the first two examples, we investigate the evolutionary dynamics of the influenza A hemagglutinin gene using labeled codon distances. In the final example, we demonstrate the advantages of using robust synonymous distances to alleviate the effect of convergent evolution on phylogenetic analysis of an {HIV} transmission network.},

@article{minin2008,
	Abstract = {Kingman's coalescent process opens the door for estimation of population genetics model parameters from molecular sequences. One paramount parameter of interest is the effective population size. Temporal variation of this quantity characterizes the demographic history of a population. Because researchers are rarely able to choose a priori a deterministic model describing effective population size dynamics for data at hand, nonparametric curve-fitting methods based on multiple change-point ({MCP)} models have been developed. We propose an alternative to change-point modeling that exploits Gaussian Markov random fields to achieve temporal smoothing of the effective population size in a Bayesian framework. The main advantage of our approach is that, in contrast to {MCP} models, the explicit temporal smoothing does not require strong prior decisions. To approximate the posterior distribution of the population dynamics, we use efficient, fast mixing Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms designed for highly structured Gaussian models. In a simulation study, we demonstrate that the proposed temporal smoothing method, named Bayesian skyride, successfully recovers ``true'' population size trajectories in all simulation scenarios and competes well with the {MCP} approaches without evoking strong prior assumptions. We apply our Bayesian skyride method to 2 real data sets. We analyze sequences of hepatitis C virus contemporaneously sampled in Egypt, reproducing all key known aspects of the viral population dynamics. Next, we estimate the demographic histories of human influenza A hemagglutinin sequences, serially sampled throughout 3 flu seasons.},

As a consequence, viral genomes become valuable resources to reconstruct the spatial and temporal processes that are shaping epidemic or endemic dynamics. In molecular epidemiology, spatial inference is often limited to the interpretation of evolutionary histories with respect to the sampling locations of the pathogens. To test hypotheses about the spatial diffusion patterns of viruses, analytical techniques are required that enable us to reconstruct how viruses migrated in the past. Here, we develop a model to infer diffusion processes among discrete locations in timed evolutionary histories in a statistically efficient fashion. Applications to Avian Influenza A {H5N1} and Rabies virus in Central and West African dogs demonstrate several advantages of simultaneously inferring spatial and temporal processes from gene sequences.},

	Abstract = {Phylogenetic patterns of the three polymerase ({PB2}, {PB1} and {PA)} genes of a total of 20 influenza B viruses isolated during a 58 year period, 1940--1998, were analysed in detail in a parallel manner. All three polymerase genes consistently showed evolutionary divergence into two major distinct lineages and their amino acid profiles demonstrated conserved lineage-specific substitutions. Dendrogram topologies of the {PB2} and {PB1} genes were very similar and contrasted with that of the {PA} gene. It was of particular interest to reveal that even though the {PA} gene evolved into two major lineages, that of three recent Asian Victoria/1/87-like strains formed a branch cluster located in the same lineage as that of recent Yamagata/16/88-like isolates. Differences in the phylogenetic pathways of three polymerase genes were not only a reflection of genetic reassortment between co-circulating influenza B viruses, but also an indication that the polymerase genes were not co-evolving as a unit. As a result, comparison of the phylogenetic patterns of the three polymerase genes with previously determined patterns of the {HA}, {NP}, M and {NS} genes of 18 viruses defined the existence of eight distinct genome constellations. Also, similar phylogenetic profiles among the {PA}, {NP} and M genes, as well as between the {PB2} and {PB1} genes, were observed, suggesting possible functional interactions among these proteins. Completion of evolutionary analysis of the six internal genes and the {HA} gene of influenza B viruses revealed frequent genetic reassortment among co-circulating variable strains and suggested co-dependent evolution of genes.},

	Abstract = {Pandemic influenza has posed an increasing threat to public health worldwide in the last decade. In the 20th century, three human pandemic influenza outbreaks occurred in 1918, 1957 and 1968, causing significant mortality. A number of hypotheses have been proposed for the emergence and development of pandemic viruses, including direct introduction into humans from an avian origin and reassortment between avian and previously circulating human viruses, either directly in humans or via an intermediate mammalian host. However, the evolutionary history of the pandemic viruses has been controversial, largely due to the lack of background genetic information and rigorous phylogenetic analyses. The pandemic that emerged in early April 2009 in North America provides a unique opportunity to investigate its emergence and development both in human and animal aspects. Recent genetic analyses of data accumulated through long-term influenza surveillance provided insights into the emergence of this novel pandemic virus. In this review, we summarise the recent literature that describes the evolutionary pathway of the pandemic viruses.

The evolutionary tree constructed from nucleotide sequences suggested the following: (i) the {PB1} gene of the 1957 human pandemic strain, {A/Singapore/1/57} ({H2N2)}, was probably introduced from avian species and was maintained in humans until 1968; (ii) in the 1968 pandemic strain, {A/NT/60/68} ({H3N2)}, the {PB1} gene was not derived from the previously circulating virus in humans but probably from another avian virus; and (iii) a current human {H3N2} virus inherited the {PB1} gene from an {A/NT/60/68-like} virus. Nucleotide sequence analysis also showed that the avian {PB1} gene was introduced into pigs. Hence, transmission of the {PB1} gene from avian to mammalian species is a relatively frequent event. Comparative analysis of deduced amino acid sequences disclosed highly conserved regions in {PB1} proteins, which may be key structures required for {PB1} activities.},

	Abstract = {Author {SummaryReassortment} is the process by which influenza viruses, which carry {RNA} genomes comprising eight segments, exchange genetic material. Reassortment of the genome segments of two differing influenza strains has the potential to vastly increase the diversity of circulating influenza viruses. Despite its importance to influenza virus evolution, the frequency with which reassortment occurs in a cell or an animal infected with two or more variant viruses is unclear. Toward determining how readily reassortment can occur, we assessed the incidence of reassortment during experimental infection in cultured cells and in guinea pigs. We found that reassortment can occur with high efficiency in both systems, but that that efficiency is dependent on i) the dose of each virus added to the cells or taken up by the host and ii) the relative timing with which each virus infects. These results suggest that influenza A virus reassortment may be more prevalent in nature than one might expect based on the results of surveillance studies.},

@article{cobbin2013,
	Abstract = {The yields of egg-grown influenza vaccines are maximized by the production of a seed strain using a reassortment of the seasonal influenza virus isolate with a highly egg-adapted strain. The seed virus is selected based on high yields of viral hemagglutinin ({HA)} and expression of the surface antigens from the seasonal isolate. The remaining proteins are usually derived from the high-growth parent. However, a retrospective analysis of vaccine seeds revealed that the seasonal {PB1} gene was selected in more than 50\% of reassortment events. Using the model seasonal {H3N2} virus {A/Udorn/307/72} (Udorn) virus and the high-growth {A/Puerto} Rico/8/34 ({PR8)} virus, we assessed the influence of the source of the {PB1} gene on virus growth and vaccine yield. Classical reassortment of these two strains led to the selection of viruses that predominantly had the Udorn {PB1} gene. The presence of Udorn {PB1} in the seed virus, however, did not result in higher yields of virus or {HA} compared to the yields in the corresponding seed virus with {PR8} {PB1.} The 8-fold-fewer virions produced with the seed virus containing the Udorn {PB1} were somewhat compensated for by a 4-fold increase in {HA} per virion. A higher {HA/nucleoprotein} ({NP)} ratio was found in past vaccine preparations when the seasonal {PB1} was present, also indicative of a higher {HA} density in these vaccine viruses. As the {HA} viral {RNA} ({vRNA)} and {mRNA} levels in infected cells were similar, we propose that {PB1} selectively alters the translation of viral {mRNA.} This study helps to explain the variability of vaccine seeds with respect to {HA} yield.},

	Abstract = {To characterize the antigenic and genetic relationships of influenza B viruses isolated during the 2004--2005 season, a total of 11,707 clinical respiratory samples were tested of which 1572 (13.5\%) were positive for influenza (463 type A and 1109 type B influenza). Of the type B viruses, 348 isolates collected in different parts of Taiwan were further analyzed. Viruses belonging to both influenza B lineages, {B/Yamagata/16/88} ({B/Yam)} and {B/Victoris/2/87} ({B/Vic)} were detected, although an increasing number of {B/Vic} lineage isolates was obtained as the season progressed. Recent {B/Vic-lineage} isolates were found to have additional amino acid substitutions compared to isolates from previous seasons, indicating that viruses of this lineage continue to evolve significantly and may have the capacity to become the dominant influenza B viruses worldwide. Results presented in this report demonstrate that antigenically and genetically distinct viruses within both {B/Vic} and {B/Yam} lineages co-circulate and that reassortment among these two lineages occurs frequently contributing to the genetic diversity of the circulating strains.},

	Abstract = {{SummaryObjective}
To compare the persistence, susceptibility and resistance of influenza A and influenza B viruses in oseltamivir therapy in outpatients of various ages.
Methods
Virus isolation was done before and 4--6 days after the initiation of oseltamivir therapy for 148 patients with influenza {A/H3N2} and for 66 with influenza B in the 2003--2004 and 2004--2005 influenza seasons. Neuraminidase inhibition assay and neuraminidase or hemagglutinin sequence analysis were done using influenza viruses isolated from these patients.
Results
The virus isolation rate after oseltamivir therapy was significantly higher for influenza B (33.3\%) than for influenza {A/H3N2} (12.8\%, p\&\#xa0;\&lt;\&\#xa0;0.001). The mean {IC50} values before and after oseltamivir therapy were significantly higher in patients with influenza B (10.82 and {11.32\&\#xa0;nM}, respectively) than in patients with influenza {A/H3N2} (0.94 and {0.81\&\#xa0;nM}, respectively, both p\&\#xa0;\&lt;\&\#xa0;0.001). No significant differences in {IC50} among each age group, or no significant increase in {IC50} from before to after oseltamivir therapy was observed. Neuraminidase or hemagglutinin sequence analysis revealed no known genotype with resistance to oseltamivir.
Conclusion
Virus persistence after oseltamivir therapy was longer and {IC50} values were higher in influenza B than influenza A.},

	Abstract = {The Victoria lineage represented by {B/Victoria/2/87} is one of the two major distinctive haemagglutinin ({HA)} lineages of influenza B virus, and its recent re-emergence has aroused great concerns. However, it remains unknown when, where, and how this {HA} lineage emerged in the world. In this study, the {HA1} domain of the {HA} gene of fourteen influenza B viruses isolated in China in 1972--1984 was sequenced. The sequences were phylogenetically analyzed with the {HA1} sequences of 41 other important influenza B isolates. The results unveiled some earlier footprints of the Victoria lineage in China, and the epidemic history of the Victoria lineage could be traced back from the year 1985 to 1975. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis, the history of China, and the epidemiology of influenza B virus indicated that the Victoria lineage possibly emerged in China in the 1970s through gradual evolution from a minor lineage.},

	Abstract = {A new {B/Shangdong/7/97-like} influenza virus (Victoria/2/87 lineage) predominated during the 2002/2003 epidemic season in Finland and was estimated to account for 2246 of the 13,496 feverish upper respiratory tract infections ({URIs)} occurring among conscripts in the Finnish army. The incidence (1716/10,000 conscripts) was indicative of moderate epidemic activity at most. Analysis of the cross-reactive antibodies induced in 1988 suggests that the basis of the protection was probably established during the childhood of the conscripts. Vaccination in autumn 2002 prevented 42\% of the {URIs} during the influenza B outbreak and 71\% (95\% {CI} 42-85) of infections interpreted as influenza B. Despite the low genetic variability of the Shangdong/7/97-like viruses, breakages of a potential glycosylation site in haemagglutinin ({HA1}, position 197) were frequent; their biological significance is discussed. The Shangdong/7/97-like strains were {HA1/NA} reassortants, as were also the less abundant strains that for {HA1} belonged to the {B/Yamagata/16/88} lineage. A further reassortment, which probably emerged during the outbreak in one of the garrisons, supports our hypothesis that circumstances in these settings may especially favour the emergence of diversity by reassortment.},

	Abstract = {The segmented genome of influenza B virus allows exchange of gene segments between cocirculating strains. Through this process of reassortment, diversity is generated by the mixing of genes between viruses that differ in one or more gene segments. Phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses of all 11 genes of 31 influenza B viruses isolated from 1979 to 2003 were used to study the evolution of whole genomes. All 11 genes diverged into two new lineages prior to 1987. All genes except the {NS1} gene were undergoing linear evolution, although the rate of evolution and the degree to which nucleotide changes translated into amino acid changes varied between lineages and by gene. Frequent reassortment generated 14 different genotypes distinct from the gene constellation of viruses circulating prior to 1979. Multiple genotypes cocirculated in some locations, and a sequence of reassortment events over time could not be established. The surprising diversity of the viruses, unrestricted mixing of lineages, and lack of evidence for coevolution of gene segments do not support the hypothesis that the reassortment process is driven by selection for functional differences.},

	Abstract = {To characterize the genetic diversity of influenza B viruses isolated during one influenza season, the antigenic and genetic relationships among 20 strains of influenza B virus isolated in February and March 2001 at one pediatric clinic in Yamagata City, Japan, were investigated. The {HA} gene and seven other gene segments were phylogenetically divided into three distinct sublineages (Harbin/7/94-, Tokyo/6/98-, and {Shiga/T30/98-related} lineage) of the Yamagata/16/88-like lineage. The {NS} genes of the viruses belonging to the Harbin/7/94-related lineage have additional three nucleotides at positions 439--447, and were phylogenetically distinguishable from those of the currently circulating Yamagata/16/88- and Victoria/2/87-like lineages, but were closely related to that of the Yamagata/16/88-like lineage isolated before 1994. Moreover, four strains of influenza B virus isolated in the same community between 2002 and 2003 were further examined. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that a virus of Victoria/2/87-like lineage isolated in 2003 had acquired the {NA}, {NS}, M, and {PA} gene segments from a {Shiga/T30/98-like} virus, and two strains of Harbin/7/94-related lineage had acquired the various gene segments from {Shiga/T30/98-like} virus through a reassortment event. These results indicate that genetically distinct multiple viruses can combine to cause an influenza B epidemic in a community and that the frequent reassortment among these viruses plays a role in generating the genetic diversity of influenza B viruses.

	Abstract = {From 2000 to 2002, human influenza A and B viruses that were genetic reassortants of contemporary circulating human strains, were isolated in South East Asia and Oceania. Similar to reports from other regions, A({H1N2)} isolates were found to be reassortants of circulating A({H3N2)} viruses that had acquired only the haeamagglutinin gene of an A({H1N1)} virus. Some of these reassortants from Thailand and Singapore predate those previously recorded during the winter of 2001--2002 in Europe and the Middle East and may be precursors of these viruses. The B reassortants had a haemagglutinin similar to an earlier B strain, {B/Shangdong/7/97} ({B/Victoria/2/87-lineage)} and a neuraminidase similar to the recently circulating {B/Sichuan/379/99} virus ({B/Yamagata/16/88-lineage).} Despite the early occurrences of A({H1N2)} reassortants and the extensive circulation of A(H1) viruses in South East Asia and Oceania during 2000--2001, these reassortant influenza A viruses have to date not been prominent unlike Europe and the Middle East where they were common in the 2001--2002 winter. In contrast the reassortant B viruses, which first emerged in this region in early 2002, rapidly became the predominant strains isolated from patients with influenza B in South East Asia and Oceania.},

	Abstract = {During the 2001--2002 influenza season, virological surveillance highlighted the predominant circulation of B viruses (86\% of isolates) in Italy, in contrast to many other countries in Europe and North America where {AH3N2} viruses were isolated most frequently, and in contrast to the infrequent isolation of B viruses in Italy during the previous two years. Associated with this predominance of influenza B was the re-emergence of {B/Victoria/2/87-lineage} viruses, closely related to B viruses prevalent during the 1980s, which are distinct antigenically and genetically from circulating {B/Sichuan/379/99-like} viruses of the {B/Yamagata/16/88} lineage, which predominated in most parts of the world during the last 10 years. Ninety-four viruses isolated in two regions of northern Italy were characterized, 50 by direct sequencing of haemagglutinin ({HA).} Viruses of both Victoria and Yamagata lineages co-circulated throughout the 12 weeks of the influenza season. The {HAs} of the Yamagata-lineage viruses were heterogeneous and comprised two sublineages, represented by {B/Sichuan/379/99} and {B/Harbin/7/94}, whereas the Victoria-lineage viruses were more homogeneous and closely related to {B/Hong} Kong/330/01, the current prototype vaccine strain. The antigenic and genetic characteristics of the viruses correlated with certain epidemiological features. In particular, the low age ({\textless}14 years) of individuals infected with {B/Hong} Kong/330/01-like viruses is likely to reflect the greater susceptibility of the youngest cohort, due to lack of previous exposure to Victoria-lineage viruses, and is consistent with the conclusion that vaccination with a {B/Sichuan/379/99-like} virus would give poor protection against infection with {B/Hong} Kong/330/01-like (Victoria-lineage) viruses.

	Abstract = {Two antigenically and genetically distinct lineages of influenza B viruses, represented by the reference strains {B/Victoria/2/1987} and {B/Yamagata/16/1988}, have cocirculated in humans since at least 1983. Between 1992 and 2000, Victoria lineage viruses were detected only in eastern Asia. From March to September of 2001 and during the 2001--2002 influenza season, Victoria lineage viruses were detected for the first time in a decade in several countries including Canada, {USA}, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Philippines, India, and Oman. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin ({HA)} gene of these viruses revealed that the viruses fell into two distinct clades: one group, represented by the reference strain {B/Hong} Kong/330/2001, contained viruses sharing three signature amino acids, Arg116, Asn121, and Glu164, while the other group of viruses, represented by {B/Oman/16296/2001}, shared Thr121 compared to the previous reference strain, {B/Shandong/7/97.} A number of the viruses in the latter group have been found to be reassortants having a Victoria lineage {HA} and a Yamagata lineage {NA.} In the current 2001--2002 season, Victoria-like viruses have now been associated with outbreaks in Asia, Europe, and North America. The reemergence of these Victoria lineage viruses worldwide, the fact that the majority of the {B/Victoria-like} isolates have poor cross-reactivity to {B/Sichuan/379/99-like} viruses in current vaccines, and the lack of exposure of young children in many areas of the world to these viruses has resulted in a World Health Organization Northern Hemisphere recommendation for the inclusion of a {B/Victoria-like} strain in vaccines for the 2002--2003 influenza season.},

	Abstract = {The evolution of influenza B viruses is poorly understood. Reassortment of influenza B viruses in nature as a means of genetic variation has not been considered to be a major contributor to their evolution. However, the current practice of assigning evolutionary relationships by antigenic analysis of the hemagglutinin of influenza B viruses would fail to detect reassortants. In this study, influenza B viruses isolated within the past 10 years from sites in the United States and China were studied by nucleotide sequencing of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes and construction of phylogenetic trees to assess evolutionary relationships. A group of viruses represented by {B/Houston/1/92} possess a hemagglutinin derived from a {B/Yamagata/16/88-like} strain and a neuraminidase derived from a {B/Victoria/2/87-like} strain. A second reassortment event between the hemagglutinin of a {B/Yamagata/16/88-like} virus closely related to the {B/Beijing/184/93} strain and the neuraminidase of a {B/Victoria/2/87-like} strain is represented by a single virus, {B/Memphis/3/93.} The neuraminidase of the reassortant viruses is most closely related to that of {B/Victoria/2/87-like} viruses currently circulating in Nanchang, China. A pattern of insertions and deletions in the hemagglutinin and the neuraminidase of different strains of influenza B viruses is observed. Reassortment plays a role in the evolution of influenza B viruses and may necessitate a change in the methods used to assess and identify new influenza viruses.},

	Abstract = {Phylogenetic profiles of the genes coding for the hemagglutinin ({HA)} protein, nucleoprotein ({NP)}, matrix (M) protein, and nonstructural ({NS)} proteins of influenza B viruses isolated from 1940 to 1998 were analyzed in a parallel manner in order to understand the evolutionary mechanisms of these viruses. Unlike human influenza A ({H3N2)} viruses, the evolutionary pathways of all four genes of recent influenza B viruses revealed similar patterns of genetic divergence into two major lineages. Although evolutionary rates of the {HA}, {NP}, M, and {NS} genes of influenza B viruses were estimated to be generally lower than those of human influenza A viruses, genes of influenza B viruses demonstrated complex phylogenetic patterns, indicating alternative mechanisms for generation of virus variability. Topologies of the evolutionary trees of each gene were determined to be quite distinct from one another, showing that these genes were evolving in an independent manner. Furthermore, variable topologies were apparently the result of frequent genetic exchange among cocirculating epidemic viruses. Evolutionary analysis done in the present study provided further evidence for cocirculation of multiple lineages as well as sequestering and reemergence of phylogenetic lineages of the internal genes. In addition, comparison of deduced amino acid sequences revealed a novel amino acid deletion in the {HA1} domain of the {HA} protein of recent isolates from 1998 belonging to the {B/Yamagata/16/88-like} lineage. It thus became apparent that, despite lower evolutionary rates, influenza B viruses were able to generate genetic diversity among circulating viruses through a combination of evolutionary mechanisms involving cocirculating lineages and genetic reassortment by which new variants with distinct gene constellations emerged.},

	Abstract = {New antigenic variants of {B/Yamagata/16/88-like} lineage which appeared in the season of 1997 as a minor strain tended to predominate in the following season. Also, we could observe for the first time, three peaks of activity caused by {H3N2} virus and two variants of B influenza virus. Antigenic and phylogenetic analyses revealed that {B/Victoria/2/87-like} variants appeared again in Japan in 1997 after a nine-year absence. Influenza B viruses evolved into three major lineages, including the earliest strain (I), {B/Yamagata/16/88-like} variants ({II)}, which comprised of three sublineages ({II-(i)}, {II-(ii)}, {II-(iii))}, and {B/Victoria/2/87-like} variants ({III).} Evolution of influenza B virus hemagglutinin was apparently distinguishable from that of influenza A virus, showing a systematic mechanism of nucleotide deletion and insertion. This phenomenon was observed to be closely related to evolutionary pathways of I, {II-(i)}, {II-(ii)}, {II-(iii)} and {III} lineages. It was noteworthy to reveal that the nucleotide deletion and insertion mechanism of influenza B virus completed one cycle over a fifty-year period, and that a three nucleotide deletion was again observed in 1997 strains belonging to lineage {II-(} iii). It was evident that amino acid substitutions accompanying nucleotide insertions were highly conserved.},

@article{rota1990,
	Abstract = {During 1988--1989 two highly distinct antigenic variants of influenza type B were recognized in hemagglutination-inhibition tests with postinfection ferret serum. These viruses were antigenically related to either {BNictoria/2/87}, the most recent reference strain, or {BNamagata/16/88}, a variant that was isolated in Japan in May 1988. All influenza B viruses isolated in the United States during an epidemic in the winter of 1988--1989 were antigenically related to B/ Victoria/2/87. However, in several countries in Asia, both {BNictoria/2/87-like} viruses and {BNamagata/16/88-like} viruses were isolated. Sequence analysis of the hemagglutinin ({HA)} genes of several influenza B isolates from 1987 to 1988 indicated that the {HA1} domains of the {BNamagata/16/88-like} viruses and {B/VI/87-like} viruses isolated in 1988 differed by 27 amino acids. Evolutionary relationships based on this sequence data indicated that the {BNamagata/16/} 88-like viruses were more closely related to epidemic viruses from 1983 ({B/USSR/100/83-like} viruses) than to more recent reference strains such as {BNictoria/2/87.} All other Asian strains, as well as selected isolates from the United States in 1988, were confirmed by sequence analysis as being genetically related to {BNictoria/2/87.} These data provide clear evidence that two parallel evolutionary pathways of influenza type B have existed since at least 1983 and that viruses from each of the separate lineages were isolated from cases of influenza B in 1988. This finding is similar to earlier observations for type A H 1 N1 and {H3N2} influenza viruses.},

@article{kanegae1990,
	Abstract = {The unexpectedly low efficacy of influenza vaccine during school outbreaks of influenza B virus in the spring of 1987 in Japan was probably attributable to a poor antibody response of vaccinees to the epidemic viruses. An antigenic analysis of the causative B viruses isolated in 1987 and 1988 showed much variation in hemagglutination inhibition patterns. The nucleotide sequences that code for the {HA1} domain of {B/Fukuoka/c-27/81}, {B/Ibaraki/2/85}, {B/Nagasaki/1/87}, and {B/Yamagata/16/88} viruses were determined and compared with those of the previously reported hemagglutinin genes. The nucleotide sequences of the hemagglutinin gene of a new variant, {B/Yamagata/16/88}, had only 93.4\% homology with those of two other viruses from the same epidemic. An analysis of nucleotide and amino acid substitutions of the hemagglutinin genes of influenza B viruses revealed that new and some old variants could cocirculate in the same epidemic. A phylogenetic tree constructed by the neighbor-joining method allowed estimation of an evolutionary rate of 2.3 x 10(-3) synonymous (silent) substitutions per nucleotide site per year in the hemagglutinin gene.},
