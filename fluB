	abstract = {During the 2001–2002 influenza season, virological surveillance highlighted the predominant circulation of B viruses (86\% of isolates) in Italy, in contrast to many other countries in Europe and North America where {AH3N2} viruses were isolated most frequently, and in contrast to the infrequent isolation of B viruses in Italy during the previous two years. Associated with this predominance of influenza B was the re-emergence of {B/Victoria/2/87-lineage} viruses, closely related to B viruses prevalent during the 1980s, which are distinct antigenically and genetically from circulating {B/Sichuan/379/99-like} viruses of the {B/Yamagata/16/88} lineage, which predominated in most parts of the world during the last 10 years. Ninety-four viruses isolated in two regions of northern Italy were characterized, 50 by direct sequencing of haemagglutinin ({HA).} Viruses of both Victoria and Yamagata lineages co-circulated throughout the 12 weeks of the influenza season. The {HAs} of the Yamagata-lineage viruses were heterogeneous and comprised two sublineages, represented by {B/Sichuan/379/99} and {B/Harbin/7/94}, whereas the Victoria-lineage viruses were more homogeneous and closely related to {B/Hong} Kong/330/01, the current prototype vaccine strain. The antigenic and genetic characteristics of the viruses correlated with certain epidemiological features. In particular, the low age ({\textless}14 years) of individuals infected with {B/Hong} Kong/330/01-like viruses is likely to reflect the greater susceptibility of the youngest cohort, due to lack of previous exposure to Victoria-lineage viruses, and is consistent with the conclusion that vaccination with a {B/Sichuan/379/99-like} virus would give poor protection against infection with {B/Hong} Kong/330/01-like (Victoria-lineage) viruses.

	abstract = {From 2000 to 2002, human influenza A and B viruses that were genetic reassortants of contemporary circulating human strains, were isolated in South East Asia and Oceania. Similar to reports from other regions, A({H1N2)} isolates were found to be reassortants of circulating A({H3N2)} viruses that had acquired only the haeamagglutinin gene of an A({H1N1)} virus. Some of these reassortants from Thailand and Singapore predate those previously recorded during the winter of 2001–2002 in Europe and the Middle East and may be precursors of these viruses. The B reassortants had a haemagglutinin similar to an earlier B strain, {B/Shangdong/7/97} ({B/Victoria/2/87-lineage)} and a neuraminidase similar to the recently circulating {B/Sichuan/379/99} virus ({B/Yamagata/16/88-lineage).} Despite the early occurrences of A({H1N2)} reassortants and the extensive circulation of A(H1) viruses in South East Asia and Oceania during 2000–2001, these reassortant influenza A viruses have to date not been prominent unlike Europe and the Middle East where they were common in the 2001–2002 winter. In contrast the reassortant B viruses, which first emerged in this region in early 2002, rapidly became the predominant strains isolated from patients with influenza B in South East Asia and Oceania.},

In this study, the {HA1} domain of the {HA} gene of fourteen influenza B viruses isolated in China in 1972–1984 was sequenced. The sequences were phylogenetically analyzed with the {HA1} sequences of 41 other important influenza B isolates. The results unveiled some earlier footprints of the Victoria lineage in China, and the epidemic history of the Victoria lineage could be traced back from the year 1985 to 1975. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis, the history of China, and the epidemiology of influenza B virus indicated that the Victoria lineage possibly emerged in China in the 1970s through gradual evolution from a minor lineage.},

	abstract = {A new {B/Shangdong/7/97-like} influenza virus (Victoria/2/87 lineage) predominated during the 2002/2003 epidemic season in Finland and was estimated to account for 2246 of the 13,496 feverish upper respiratory tract infections ({URIs)} occurring among conscripts in the Finnish army. The incidence (1716/10,000 conscripts) was indicative of moderate epidemic activity at most. Analysis of the cross-reactive antibodies induced in 1988 suggests that the basis of the protection was probably established during the childhood of the conscripts. Vaccination in autumn 2002 prevented 42\% of the {URIs} during the influenza B outbreak and 71\% (95\% {CI} 42-85) of infections interpreted as influenza B. Despite the low genetic variability of the Shangdong/7/97-like viruses, breakages of a potential glycosylation site in haemagglutinin ({HA1}, position 197) were frequent; their biological significance is discussed. The Shangdong/7/97-like strains were {HA1/NA} reassortants, as were also the less abundant strains that for {HA1} belonged to the {B/Yamagata/16/88} lineage. A further reassortment, which probably emerged during the outbreak in one of the garrisons, supports our hypothesis that circumstances in these settings may especially favour the emergence of diversity by reassortment.},

	abstract = {{SummaryObjective}
To compare the persistence, susceptibility and resistance of influenza A and influenza B viruses in oseltamivir therapy in outpatients of various ages.
Methods
Virus isolation was done before and 4–6 days after the initiation of oseltamivir therapy for 148 patients with influenza {A/H3N2} and for 66 with influenza B in the 2003–2004 and 2004–2005 influenza seasons. Neuraminidase inhibition assay and neuraminidase or hemagglutinin sequence analysis were done using influenza viruses isolated from these patients.
Results
The virus isolation rate after oseltamivir therapy was significantly higher for influenza B (33.3\%) than for influenza {A/H3N2} (12.8\%, p\&\#xa0;\&lt;\&\#xa0;0.001). The mean {IC50} values before and after oseltamivir therapy were significantly higher in patients with influenza B (10.82 and {11.32\&\#xa0;nM}, respectively) than in patients with influenza {A/H3N2} (0.94 and {0.81\&\#xa0;nM}, respectively, both p\&\#xa0;\&lt;\&\#xa0;0.001). No significant differences in {IC50} among each age group, or no significant increase in {IC50} from before to after oseltamivir therapy was observed. Neuraminidase or hemagglutinin sequence analysis revealed no known genotype with resistance to oseltamivir.
Conclusion
Virus persistence after oseltamivir therapy was longer and {IC50} values were higher in influenza B than influenza A.},

	abstract = {To characterize the genetic diversity of influenza B viruses isolated during one influenza season, the antigenic and genetic relationships among 20 strains of influenza B virus isolated in February and March 2001 at one pediatric clinic in Yamagata City, Japan, were investigated. The {HA} gene and seven other gene segments were phylogenetically divided into three distinct sublineages (Harbin/7/94-, Tokyo/6/98-, and {Shiga/T30/98-related} lineage) of the Yamagata/16/88-like lineage. The {NS} genes of the viruses belonging to the Harbin/7/94-related lineage have additional three nucleotides at positions 439–447, and were phylogenetically distinguishable from those of the currently circulating Yamagata/16/88- and Victoria/2/87-like lineages, but were closely related to that of the Yamagata/16/88-like lineage isolated before 1994. Moreover, four strains of influenza B virus isolated in the same community between 2002 and 2003 were further examined. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that a virus of Victoria/2/87-like lineage isolated in 2003 had acquired the {NA}, {NS}, M, and {PA} gene segments from a {Shiga/T30/98-like} virus, and two strains of Harbin/7/94-related lineage had acquired the various gene segments from {Shiga/T30/98-like} virus through a reassortment event. These results indicate that genetically distinct multiple viruses can combine to cause an influenza B epidemic in a community and that the frequent reassortment among these viruses plays a role in generating the genetic diversity of influenza B viruses.

Through this process of reassortment, diversity is generated by the mixing of genes between viruses that differ in one or more gene segments. Phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses of all 11 genes of 31 influenza B viruses isolated from 1979 to 2003 were used to study the evolution of whole genomes. All 11 genes diverged into two new lineages prior to 1987. All genes except the {NS1} gene were undergoing linear evolution, although the rate of evolution and the degree to which nucleotide changes translated into amino acid changes varied between lineages and by gene. Frequent reassortment generated 14 different genotypes distinct from the gene constellation of viruses circulating prior to 1979. Multiple genotypes cocirculated in some locations, and a sequence of reassortment events over time could not be established. The surprising diversity of the viruses, unrestricted mixing of lineages, and lack of evidence for coevolution of gene segments do not support the hypothesis that the reassortment process is driven by selection for functional differences.},

	abstract = {The evolution of influenza B viruses is poorly understood. Reassortment of influenza B viruses in nature as a means of genetic variation has not been considered to be a major contributor to their evolution. However, the current practice of assigning evolutionary relationships by antigenic analysis of the hemagglutinin of influenza B viruses would fail to detect reassortants. In this study, influenza B viruses isolated within the past 10 years from sites in the United States and China were studied by nucleotide sequencing of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes and construction of phylogenetic trees to assess evolutionary relationships. A group of viruses represented by {B/Houston/1/92} possess a hemagglutinin derived from a {B/Yamagata/16/88-like} strain and a neuraminidase derived from a {B/Victoria/2/87-like} strain. A second reassortment event between the hemagglutinin of a {B/Yamagata/16/88-like} virus closely related to the {B/Beijing/184/93} strain and the neuraminidase of a {B/Victoria/2/87-like} strain is represented by a single virus, {B/Memphis/3/93.} The neuraminidase of the reassortant viruses is most closely related to that of {B/Victoria/2/87-like} viruses currently circulating in Nanchang, China. A pattern of insertions and deletions in the hemagglutinin and the neuraminidase of different strains of influenza B viruses is observed. Reassortment plays a role in the evolution of influenza B viruses and may necessitate a change in the methods used to assess and identify new influenza viruses.},

Also, we could observe for the first time, three peaks of activity caused by {H3N2} virus and two variants of B influenza virus. Antigenic and phylogenetic analyses revealed that {B/Victoria/2/87-like} variants appeared again in Japan in 1997 after a nine-year absence. Influenza B viruses evolved into three major lineages, including the earliest strain (I), {B/Yamagata/16/88-like} variants ({II)}, which comprised of three sublineages ({II-(i)}, {II-(ii)}, {II-(iii))}, and {B/Victoria/2/87-like} variants ({III).} Evolution of influenza B virus hemagglutinin was apparently distinguishable from that of influenza A virus, showing a systematic mechanism of nucleotide deletion and insertion. This phenomenon was observed to be closely related to evolutionary pathways of I, {II-(i)}, {II-(ii)}, {II-(iii)} and {III} lineages. It was noteworthy to reveal that the nucleotide deletion and insertion mechanism of influenza B virus completed one cycle over a fifty-year period, and that a three nucleotide deletion was again observed in 1997 strains belonging to lineage {II-(} iii). It was evident that amino acid substitutions accompanying nucleotide insertions were highly conserved.},

	abstract = {During 1988–1989 two highly distinct antigenic variants of influenza type B were recognized in hemagglutination-inhibition tests with postinfection ferret serum. These viruses were antigenically related to either {BNictoria/2/87}, the most recent reference strain, or {BNamagata/16/88}, a variant that was isolated in Japan in May 1988. All influenza B viruses isolated in the United States during an epidemic in the winter of 1988–1989 were antigenically related to B/ Victoria/2/87. However, in several countries in Asia, both {BNictoria/2/87-like} viruses and {BNamagata/16/88-like} viruses were isolated. Sequence analysis of the hemagglutinin ({HA)} genes of several influenza B isolates from 1987 to 1988 indicated that the {HA1} domains of the {BNamagata/16/88-like} viruses and {B/VI/87-like} viruses isolated in 1988 differed by 27 amino acids. Evolutionary relationships based on this sequence data indicated that the {BNamagata/16/} 88-like viruses were more closely related to epidemic viruses from 1983 ({B/USSR/100/83-like} viruses) than to more recent reference strains such as {BNictoria/2/87.} All other Asian strains, as well as selected isolates from the United States in 1988, were confirmed by sequence analysis as being genetically related to {BNictoria/2/87.} These data provide clear evidence that two parallel evolutionary pathways of influenza type B have existed since at least 1983 and that viruses from each of the separate lineages were isolated from cases of influenza B in 1988. This finding is similar to earlier observations for type A H 1 N1 and {H3N2} influenza viruses.},

Between 1992 and 2000, Victoria lineage viruses were detected only in eastern Asia. From March to September of 2001 and during the 2001–2002 influenza season, Victoria lineage viruses were detected for the first time in a decade in several countries including Canada, {USA}, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Philippines, India, and Oman. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin ({HA)} gene of these viruses revealed that the viruses fell into two distinct clades: one group, represented by the reference strain {B/Hong} Kong/330/2001, contained viruses sharing three signature amino acids, Arg116, Asn121, and Glu164, while the other group of viruses, represented by {B/Oman/16296/2001}, shared Thr121 compared to the previous reference strain, {B/Shandong/7/97.} A number of the viruses in the latter group have been found to be reassortants having a Victoria lineage {HA} and a Yamagata lineage {NA.} In the current 2001–2002 season, Victoria-like viruses have now been associated with outbreaks in Asia, Europe, and North America. The reemergence of these Victoria lineage viruses worldwide, the fact that the majority of the {B/Victoria-like} isolates have poor cross-reactivity to {B/Sichuan/379/99-like} viruses in current vaccines, and the lack of exposure of young children in many areas of the world to these viruses has resulted in a World Health Organization Northern Hemisphere recommendation for the inclusion of a {B/Victoria-like} strain in vaccines for the 2002–2003 influenza season.},
